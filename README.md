# rsget

A simple command line utility to download a remote file, similar to
`wget`. This is not intended to be a full feature `wget` replacement
but a simple tool to test few Rust crates.

This utility makes use of following crates:

* [exitfailure](https://crates.io/crates/exitfailure)
* [failure](https://crates.io/crates/failure)
* [indicatif](https://crates.io/crates/indicatif)
* [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest)
* [structopt](https://crates.io/crates/structopt)
